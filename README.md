**Important Note**: Please Stay safe and in good health and take necessary precautions and commit to the preventive measures.

## Course Describtion
Mainly, robotics interacts with surrounding environments via both of sensors and actuators. Such that the robots is manipulate with sensors to perceive the environment, the sensors signal is interpreted and processed by CPU to decide an action and send signal to the actuators which act in the environment to achieve desired tasks. In this course we will understand the interface of electrical actuators and the required electric drives. And, also understand the basic concepts and how to extract and manipulate most popular robotics used sensors.
